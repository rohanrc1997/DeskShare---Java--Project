OOM Mini Project: Designing a Software Utility to Control and View Another Computer Remotely over a Network Connection (Remote Desktop Administration) (IIIT-A)

A PROJECT develpoed BY- Rohan Chaudhary

The program facilitates the communication among the client and the server utilizing very optimal network traffic rates, and providing low latency of events at both the server and client sides, thereby increasing the performance of the software and its practical realization in the real world applications.

Implemented using following JAVA Classes:

 Java AWT ( Abstract Windowing Toolkit )

 Robot Class: This class is used to generate native system input events for the applications where control of

the mouse and keyboard is needed.

 Socket Class: To facilitate sockets used as an endpoint for communication between two machines through

a network in java.

 Graphics and Image Classes: To draw onto graphical components that are realized on various devices, as

well as onto off-screen images, and fetching the screen capture images at the client side.
